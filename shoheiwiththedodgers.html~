	<h1> Shohei's First Spring Training Game with the Dodgers </h1>
	<p1> Shohei Ohtani, The Los Angeles Dodgers 2-way player, made his debut with the team on February 27, 2024. In it's entirety, Shohei went 2-3 with his at bats, both hits being an RBI, one being a homerun. Although his first at bat was a strike out, he made his comeback to show everyone what he's capable of. Sadly, Shohei was unable to demonstrate his 2-way abilities due to an elbow injury he adapted during his last season with the Los Angeles Angels. Shohei will be away from pitching until 2025.  </p1>
